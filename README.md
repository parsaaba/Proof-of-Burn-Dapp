# Ethereum Fullstack Template

This repository contains a `create-react-app` template that can be used to develop an ethereum dApp.

## Quick Start

1. Install [Create-React-App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) package

    ```bash
    $ npm install -g create-react-app
    ```
    
2. Create a project using this template

    ```bash
    $ create-react-app project-name --template ethereum-fullstack
    ```

3. Switching to test network (RINKEBY) (Optional)

    * Please skip this step if you want to use local network
    * Change line - `const NETWORK = LOCAL_NETWORK` to `const NETWORK = TEST_NETWORK` in `hardhat.config.js`
    * Replace `YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY` with your api key from alchemy in `.env` file
    * Replace `YOUR_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` with your wallet's private key from metamask wallet in `.env` file

4. Running test for sample contract

    ```bash
    npx hardhat test
    ```

5. Running your app
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
